# Unit Commitment

This is the application to stochastic unit commitment.

The stochastic unit commitment is modeled based on the deterministic formulation in [power-grid-lib/pglib-uc](https://github.com/power-grid-lib/pglib-uc). The scenario data is generated by using the time series data available in [GridMod/RTS-GMLC](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC).
